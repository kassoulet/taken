# Project Summary

## Overall Goal

Create a multi-registry package name checker application that allows users to check if a package name is available across multiple registries (npm, PyPI, Cargo).

## Key Knowledge

- **Technology Stack**: React 18+, TypeScript, Vite 5+, TailwindCSS 3+, Playwright for E2E testing, Vitest for unit testing
- **Architecture**: Frontend-only application with no backend dependencies, using a modular component structure
- **Testing**: Uses Playwright for E2E tests, Vitest for unit tests, ESLint for linting, Prettier for formatting
- **Key Components**:
  - NameInput component for package name entry
  - RegistryStatusGrid for displaying registry status results
  - StatusBadge for individual registry status indicators
  - Registry checker service for API interactions
  - Cache manager for performance optimization
- **Build Commands**:
  - `npm run dev` - Start development server
  - `npm run build` - Build for production
  - `npm run test` - Run unit tests
  - `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests
  - `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
  - `npm run format` - Run Prettier formatting

## Recent Actions

- Fixed TypeScript syntax error in tailwind.config.ts by changing from `satisfies` operator to proper type annotation
- Resolved formatting issues by running Prettier on all files
- Enabled automatic server startup in Playwright configuration by uncommenting the webServer section
- Successfully ran unit tests which all passed (36 tests across 7 test files)
- Addressed linting warnings by fixing unused imports and type issues in test files
- Installed missing Playwright browser dependencies for E2E testing
- Fixed several dependency version conflicts and engine compatibility warnings

## Current Plan

1. [DONE] Fix TypeScript syntax errors in configuration files
2. [DONE] Resolve formatting issues with Prettier
3. [DONE] Enable automatic server startup for Playwright tests
4. [DONE] Run and pass all unit tests
5. [IN PROGRESS] Run and pass all E2E tests with Playwright
6. [TODO] Address remaining dependency compatibility warnings
7. [TODO] Optimize build process and performance
8. [TODO] Implement additional features as specified in project requirements
