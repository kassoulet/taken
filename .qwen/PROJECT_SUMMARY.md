# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a multi-registry package name checker web application that allows users to check if a package name is available across multiple registries (npm, PyPI, Cargo) with a clean UI and no backend dependencies.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology Stack: JavaScript/TypeScript, React 18+, Vite 5+, TailwindCSS 3+, with browser sessionStorage for caching
- Architecture: Client-side only application with component-first architecture
- Project Structure: frontend code in root directory with src/, components/, services/, hooks/, utils/ directories
- Build Commands: `npm run test && npm run lint` for testing and linting
- Testing: Uses Jest, React Testing Library, Playwright for e2e tests
- The application features real-time input validation, debouncing, parallel registry checking, and caching
- Dark mode is supported and respects system preference
- Package name validation per registry-specific rules with comprehensive input sanitization

## Recent Actions
- Successfully added credits footer at the bottom of the page for Gautier Portet with GitHub URL
- Created comprehensive README.md file with project details, usage instructions, and development guidelines
- Added new test setup file (tests/setup.ts) and vitest config (vitest.config.ts)
- Fixed TypeScript linting issues by updating `@ts-ignore` to `@ts-expect-error` with proper description
- Successfully committed all changes with the message "Add credits footer and README, update specs"
- The footer includes a link to Gautier Portet's GitHub profile as requested
