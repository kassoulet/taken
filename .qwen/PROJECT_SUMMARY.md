# Project Summary

## Overall Goal

Create a multi-registry checker tool that allows users to verify if a Docker image exists across different registries and provides information about the image, implemented as a frontend-only React application.

## Key Knowledge

- **Technology Stack**: JavaScript/TypeScript frontend with React 18+, Vite 5+ bundling, TailwindCSS 3+ styling
- **Architecture**: No backend dependencies, uses browser sessionStorage for caching query results during the session
- **Project Structure**: Standard Vite/React frontend with backend/, frontend/, and tests/ directories
- **Build Commands**: `npm run test && npm run lint` for running tests and linting
- **Code Style**: Follow standard JavaScript/TypeScript conventions with HTML/CSS for UI

## Recent Actions

- Established project context and development guidelines from QWEN.md
- Attempted to run `npm test` but the command was cancelled by the user
- No specific development work has been completed yet on the multi-registry checker feature

## Current Plan

- [TODO] Set up the basic React application structure
- [TODO] Implement the multi-registry checker UI components
- [TODO] Add functionality to check Docker image existence across registries
- [TODO] Implement session-based caching using sessionStorage
- [TODO] Create tests for the application functionality
- [TODO] Run linting and testing to ensure code quality
