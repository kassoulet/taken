# Project Summary

## Overall Goal

Create a multi-registry package name checker application that allows users to check the availability of package names across different registries (NPM, Python, etc.) from a single interface.

## Key Knowledge

- **Technology Stack**: JavaScript/TypeScript frontend with React 18+, Vite 5+ bundling, TailwindCSS 3+ styling
- **Architecture**: Frontend-only application with no backend dependencies, uses browser sessionStorage for caching
- **Project Structure**: `/frontend/`, `/backend/`, `/tests/` directories with React components, hooks, services, and utilities
- **Build Commands**: `npm run test && npm run lint` for running tests and linting
- **Key Features**: Package availability checking across registries, registry status display, dark mode support, debounced input, package information display (author, version, license, last update)
- **Testing**: Uses Playwright for e2e tests and Vitest for unit tests
- **File Handling**: .gitignore updated to exclude test results and reports
