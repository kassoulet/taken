# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To develop a multi-registry checker application that allows users to verify package availability across different registries (npm, PyPI, etc.) with a React-based frontend UI.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology stack: JavaScript/TypeScript frontend with React 18+, Vite 5+ bundling, TailwindCSS 3+ styling
- Project structure: Backend, frontend, and tests directories
- Caching mechanism: Browser sessionStorage for query results during the session
- Testing: Uses `npm test && npm run lint` as the primary test command located in the frontend directory
- Frontend directory contains package.json and all necessary build configurations
- Architecture: No backend dependencies, pure frontend application

## Recent Actions
- Attempted to run tests with `npm test && npm run lint` in the frontend directory
- Discovered that the package.json file is located in the frontend/ directory, not the project root
- Multiple attempts to run tests failed due to user cancellation of the tool execution

## Current Plan
1. [TODO] Successfully run tests in the frontend directory to verify current state
2. [TODO] Run linting to check code quality
3. [TODO] Investigate why test execution was being cancelled
4. [TODO] Analyze test results and address any issues found
