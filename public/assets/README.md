# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets that will be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Any files placed in this directory will be accessible via the website at the path `/assets/filename.ext`.

For example:

- Adding `logo.png` here will make it available at `https://kassoulet.github.io/taken/assets/logo.png`
