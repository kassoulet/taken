# Research Summary: Multi-Registry Package Name Checker

## Registry API Documentation and Patterns

### npm Registry

- Base URL: `https://registry.npmjs.org/{package-name}`
- Returns 200 with package data if exists, 404 if not found
- No authentication required for public packages
- Rate limiting exists but generally allows frequent requests from browsers
- CORS-enabled for browser requests

### PyPI Registry

- Base URL: `https://pypi.org/pypi/{package-name}/json`
- Returns 200 with package data if exists, 404 if not found
- No authentication required
- CORS-enabled for browser requests

### Cargo Registry (crates.io)

- Base URL: `https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/{package-name}`
- Returns 200 with crate data if exists, 404 if not found
- No authentication required
- CORS-enabled for browser requests

## Architecture Decision: Frontend Only with Client-Side Fetch

### Decision

The application will be implemented as a frontend-only Single Page Application using React and Vite, with all processing happening client-side.

### Rationale

- Aligns with the requirement that no backend is needed (FR-004)
- Modern browsers support CORS requests to the specified registries
- Allows for caching results in browser sessionStorage (per clarification)
- Provides fast UI interactions without server round trips

### Alternatives Considered

- Backend proxy service: Would violate the "no backend required" constraint
- Static site with client-side JS: Would work but React provides better component architecture
- Native mobile app: Would add complexity without clear benefit

## Input Validation and Sanitization Strategy

### Decision

Implement comprehensive input sanitization to meet security requirements as specified in clarifications and constitution.

### Rationale

- Prevents XSS attacks and injection vulnerabilities (per constitution II)
- Complies with the security clarification (Q7: Yes - implement comprehensive input sanitization)
- Validates per registry rules while preventing special character entry (per clarification Q6)

### Implementation

- Real-time character filtering to prevent invalid inputs
- Input sanitization before making API requests
- Sanitize any data received from APIs before displaying (defense in depth)
- Sanitize for HTML injection, XSS prevention

## Package Name Validation Strategy

### Decision

Validate package names per each registry's specific rules, but restrict input to commonly accepted characters across all registries as determined by the clarification session.

### Rationale

- Reduces invalid API calls to registries
- Provides better user experience by catching formatting issues early
- Follows the clarified requirement from the specification

### Implementation

- Only allow alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores, and dots
- Check for registry-specific rules during validation
- npm: Allow scoped packages (e.g., @scope/name)
- PyPI: Follow PEP 508 naming conventions
- Cargo: Follow Rust naming conventions

## Browser Storage Strategy

### Decision

Use sessionStorage for caching query results instead of localStorage to respect user privacy and session-based expectations as clarified.

### Rationale

- Aligns with the clarification that caching should only last for the current browser session
- sessionStorage is automatically cleared when the browser tab/window is closed
- Maintains privacy expectations of users
- Simpler than managing time-based expiration for persistent storage
- No explicit timeout needed as per clarification Q10 (session-based only)

## Error Handling Approach

### Decision

Treat all registry errors the same way with a generic "error" status as specified in the clarifications.

### Rationale

- Simplifies the UI and user experience
- Avoids complexity of differentiating between error types
- Consistent with the specified requirement
- Provides clear feedback to users without overwhelming them with technical details

## Timeout Configuration

### Decision

Implement a 10-second timeout for all registry API calls as specified in the clarifications.

### Rationale

- Provides reasonable balance between user experience and waiting for slow responses
- Consistent with the clarified requirement
- Allows for most legitimate API responses while avoiding hanging requests

## Technology Stack Justification

### Frontend Framework: React

- Component-based architecture suitable for the grid of registry status cards
- Large ecosystem and community support
- Good tooling and development experience
- Suitable for the interactive nature of this application
- Required by constitution (React 18+)

### Build Tool: Vite

- Fast development server with hot module replacement
- Modern tooling with good TypeScript support
- Better performance than alternatives like Create React App
- Required by constitution (Vite)

### Styling: TailwindCSS

- Rapid UI development
- Responsive by default
- Good for creating the registry status badges and grid layout
- Keeps styling close to components
- Required by constitution (TailwindCSS)

### Security Implementation

- Input sanitization using DOMPurify or similar library
- Proper escaping of user input before display
- Validation of all API responses before processing
- Prevention of injection attacks

### Accessibility Features

- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Proper ARIA attributes for dynamic content updates
- Semantic HTML structure
- Focus management
- Color contrast compliance with WCAG standards

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Component-level tests using React Testing Library
- Service logic tests for registry checking and caching
- Utility function tests for validators and sanitizers

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end flow tests
- API integration tests (contract tests)
- Cross-component interaction tests

### Accessibility Tests

- Automated accessibility checks using axe-core
- Keyboard navigation tests
- Screen reader compatibility
