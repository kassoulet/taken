# Feature Specification: Multi-Registry Package Name Checker

**Feature Branch**: `001-multi-registry-checker`
**Created**: Saturday, October 25, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "'Taken', a web app that checks if a given package name is available across multiple open-source package registries — no backend required."

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Check Package Name Availability (Priority: P1)

A user wants to quickly verify if a package name is taken across multiple registries before creating a new package. They enter a package name and receive immediate feedback on the availability status for each registry (npm, PyPI, Cargo).

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality of the application - enabling users to check package name availability before starting development work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by entering a package name and seeing the status results for each registry. Delivers the primary value of preventing name conflicts across registries.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user accesses the application, **When** user enters a package name that exists on npm, **Then** the npm registry status shows "taken"
2. **Given** user enters a package name that doesn't exist on any registry, **When** the check is performed, **Then** all registries show "available" status

### User Story 2 - View Multiple Registry Statuses Simultaneously (Priority: P1)

A user needs to see the availability of their desired package name across all supported registries in a single view. The system displays a grid of registry cards showing the status for each registry.

**Why this priority**: Essential for the primary use case - comparing availability across multiple registries simultaneously.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by entering a package name and verifying that all registry cards are displayed with appropriate status badges.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user enters a package name, **When** results load, **Then** all registry cards (npm, PyPI, Cargo) are displayed with status indicators

---

### User Story 3 - Reduce API Requests with Caching (Priority: P2)

A user repeatedly checks the same package names over time. The application caches recent queries to minimize network requests and improve response time.

**Why this priority**: Improves user experience by reducing wait times for frequently checked names and reduces load on external APIs.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by checking a name twice within 5 minutes and verifying the second check uses cached data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user checks a package name, **When** they check the same name again within 5 minutes, **Then** the cached result is shown immediately

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when external registries are down or return errors?
- How does system handle malformed package names or special characters?
- What occurs when access is blocked to certain registries?
- How does the system handle timeout responses?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a simple text input for users to enter a package name
- **FR-002**: System MUST query multiple registries (npm, PyPI, Cargo) using public endpoints
- **FR-003**: System MUST show whether each registry status is "available", "taken", or "error"
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle all logic client-side
- **FR-005**: System MUST debounce user input to avoid excessive requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST cache recent queries to avoid re-fetching
- **FR-007**: System MUST treat successful responses as "taken", "not found" responses as "available", and other responses as "error"
- **FR-008**: System MUST display registry status using clear visual indicators (badges, colors)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a responsive UI that works across different screen sizes
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle access-blocking gracefully by showing appropriate warnings to the user
- **FR-011**: System MUST check registries in parallel to optimize response time
- **FR-012**: System MUST clear cached data after a specified time period
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate package name format per each registry's specific rules

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **PackageName**: The identifier entered by the user to check across registries
- **RegistryStatus**: The result for a specific package name on a specific registry, with possible values: "available", "taken", or "error"
- **Registry**: An external package registry (npm, PyPI, Cargo) that supports the package name lookup
- **CachedQuery**: A stored result from a previous query with timestamp for expiration tracking

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can enter a package name and see results from all registries within 5 seconds under normal network conditions
- **SC-002**: System supports checking package names across 3 major registries (npm, PyPI, Cargo) simultaneously
- **SC-003**: 95% of package name checks return a definitive status (available/taken) rather than error when registries are accessible
- **SC-004**: 90% of repeat queries within 5 minutes are served from cache without additional API calls
- **SC-005**: Users can successfully use the application on both desktop and mobile browsers without functionality loss

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-25

- Q: How should package name format validation be handled? → A: Validate per registry rules
- Q: How should different types of registry errors be prioritized? → A: Treat all errors the same way with a generic "error" status
- Q: Should cached data persist across browser sessions? → A: Cache only lasts for the current browser session (sessionStorage)
- Q: How should special characters in package names be handled? → A: Restrict input to only commonly accepted characters across all registries
- Q: What should be the timeout duration for registry API calls? → A: 10-second timeout for all registry calls
- Q: When should validation errors be shown to users? → A: Prevent special character entry in real-time
- Q: Should input sanitization be implemented for security? → A: Yes - Implement comprehensive input sanitization to meet security requirements
- Q: Should performance monitoring be included in the application? → A: No - Monitoring is not part of the core functionality
- Q: Should accessibility requirements be specified? → A: Limited accessibility - Only basic requirements
- Q: Should cache have an explicit expiration timeframe? → A: Session-based only - No explicit timeout needed
