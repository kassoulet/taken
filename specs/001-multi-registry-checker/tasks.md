# Tasks: Multi-Registry Package Name Checker

**Feature**: Multi-Registry Package Name Checker
**Generated**: Saturday, October 25, 2025
**Branch**: 001-multi-registry-checker

## Overview

This document contains the implementation tasks for the Multi-Registry Package Name Checker, a frontend-only web application that checks package name availability across multiple open-source registries using client-side logic only.

### Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows an incremental delivery approach:

- **MVP**: Focus on User Story 1 (core functionality) with basic UI and registry checking
- **Increment 2**: Add User Story 2 (multiple registry visualization)
- **Increment 3**: Add User Story 3 (caching functionality)
- **Polish**: Add error handling, validation, and responsive design

Each user story is designed to be independently testable and deliverable.

## Dependencies

User Story 1 (Core Functionality) → User Story 2 (Visualization) → User Story 3 (Caching)

## Parallel Execution Examples

- **Per User Story**: NameInput, StatusBadge, and RegistryStatusGrid components can be developed in parallel
- **Per Layer**: Component development can parallelize with service implementation
- **Testing**: Unit tests can be written in parallel with component/service implementation

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Check Package Name Availability (Priority: P1)

### Story Goal

A user wants to quickly verify if a package name is taken across multiple registries before creating a new package. They enter a package name and receive immediate feedback on the availability status for each registry (npm, PyPI, Cargo).

### Independent Test Criteria

Can be fully tested by entering a package name and seeing the status results for each registry. Delivers the primary value of preventing name conflicts across registries.

### Tasks

- [x] T014 [US1] Create NameInput component with real-time validation in frontend/src/components/NameInput/
- [x] T050 [US1] Integrate input sanitization in NameInput component before making API calls in frontend/src/components/NameInput/
- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Create StatusBadge component for registry status display in frontend/src/components/StatusBadge/
- [x] T053 [P] Add keyboard navigation support to RegistryStatusGrid component in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T016 [P] [US1] Create RegistryStatusGrid component to display registry statuses in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T017 [US1] Integrate NameInput with registry-checker service in frontend/src/App.jsx
- [x] T051 [US1] Sanitize all registry responses before displaying to prevent XSS in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
- [x] T018 [US1] Display results from registry-checker service in frontend/src/App.jsx
- [x] T019 [US1] Implement timeout handling (10 seconds) for registry calls in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
- [x] T020 [US1] Handle success (200) and not found (404) responses per spec requirements in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
- [x] T064 [US1] Implement metrics collection to track success rate per SC-003 in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - View Multiple Registry Statuses Simultaneously (Priority: P1)

### Story Goal

A user needs to see the availability of their desired package name across all supported registries in a single view. The system displays a grid of registry cards showing the status for each registry.

### Independent Test Criteria

Can be tested by entering a package name and verifying that all registry cards are displayed with appropriate status badges.

### Tasks

- [x] T021 [US2] Enhance RegistryStatusGrid to display all registries simultaneously in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T022 [P] [US2] Update StatusBadge with consistent visual indicators for available/taken/error in frontend/src/components/StatusBadge/
- [x] T023 [P] [US2] Add responsive design to RegistryStatusGrid using Tailwind CSS in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T024 [US2] Add loading states to StatusBadge component in frontend/src/components/StatusBadge/
- [x] T025 [US2] Implement parallel registry checking using Promise.all in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
- [x] T026 [US2] Add visual feedback for loading states in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T027 [US2] Update App.jsx to handle multiple simultaneous registry checks in frontend/src/App.jsx

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Reduce API Requests with Caching (Priority: P2)

### Story Goal

A user repeatedly checks the same package names over time. The application caches recent queries to minimize network requests and improve response time.

### Independent Test Criteria

Can be tested by checking a name twice within 5 minutes and verifying the second check uses cached data.

### Tasks

- [x] T028 [US3] Integrate cache-manager with registry-checker service in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
- [x] T029 [P] [US3] Update NameInput to check cache before making network requests in frontend/src/components/NameInput/
- [x] T030 [P] [US3] Add cache hit indicators to registry display in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T031 [US3] Implement cache storage using sessionStorage per spec requirements in frontend/src/services/cache-manager.js
- [x] T032 [P] [US3] Add cache key generation using registry and package name format per spec in frontend/src/services/cache-manager.js
- [x] T033 [US3] Update registry-checker to store results in cache after successful requests in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
- [x] T063 [US3] Implement session-based cache management with automatic cleanup in frontend/src/services/cache-manager.js

## Phase 6: Error Handling & Edge Cases

### Goal

Handle external registry errors, malformed inputs, and timeout responses as specified.

### Tasks

- [x] T034 Handle registry errors consistently with generic "error" status per clarification in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
- [x] T035 [P] Update StatusBadge to display error status with appropriate styling in frontend/src/components/StatusBadge/
- [x] T036 [P] Add error handling to RegistryStatusGrid for display in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T037 Implement input restriction to prevent special characters per clarification in frontend/src/components/NameInput/
- [x] T038 Add error message display when registries are down in frontend/src/components/RegistryStatusGrid/
- [x] T039 Handle CORS restrictions gracefully with appropriate UI feedback in frontend/src/services/registry-checker.js
